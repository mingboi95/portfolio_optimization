# Portfolio Optimization with Quadratic Transaction Costs

This work could not have been possible without the great portfolio optimization library [PyPortfolioOpt](https://github.com/robertmartin8/PyPortfolioOpt)

`market_impact_final` is our documented code for the implementation of the Market Impact Model as stated in Frazzini et al (2018).  

`code` is our backtesting using Non-Linear Factor Modelling on US equities using RNN/LSTM/GRU. This includes implementation for the Optimized Market Impact portfolio and the Optimized Mean-Variance portfolio

`pf_daily-final` and `pf_results-final` contains our backtest results
