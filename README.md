# Portfolio Optimization with Quadratic Transaction Costs

- `arxiv` is our final report.
- `market_impact_final` is our documented code for the implementation of the Market Impact Model in Frazzini et al (2018), to estimate the transaction cost of any arbitrary trade. 
- `code` is our backtesting using alphas from non-linear factor modelling on US equities using RNNs, which also includes implementation for the Optimized Market Impact portfolio and the Optimized Mean-Variance portfolio. 
- `pf_daily-final` and `pf_results-final` contains our backtest results.
- Macquarie Quant Alpha Model numbers are taken from Borghi & Giuliano (2020).
